You should be able to just download/clone the project and run it with a http server immediately. You only need to `pnpm install` to test building.

Easy ways to run a http server:
```shell
pnpm start
python -m http.server
```

Please remember to test build before you pullrequest (especially if you add anything to parcel).

- If you have an idea please leave it in the form of an issue.
- If you would like to start coding, feel free to fork and pull request when you are ready.
- If you find a bug leave an issue or fix it with a pullrequest.
